# monet-x-change
> (read as money exchange)

So this is a dashboard that displays various currencies cotations by hitting an API and saving that. It simulates a database in locaStorage, so the DB is only initialized once you start using it.

The chart points are fetched every 5 minutes you are on the page and start to pile up from there
